FIRST BUILD:
- Display a basic flat map (can later push for different levels of ground)
	- Small crop field with dirt plots (only beans for this demo... harvesting lowers hunger)
	- A few basic trees (harvesting just re-plants a new one, gives wood)
	- A basic bed used for jumping to daytime (sleeping lowers exhaustion)
	- Small river/creek (adrinking lowers thirst)
	- Basic day/night cycle
	
- Display a basic UI with counts for amounts of food and wood, as well as character stats like hunger, thirst, and exhaustion

- A character can move around the map with clicks
	- Clicking a tree will make them walk to it, chop it down (2 seconds, add chop sound) and get more wood
	- Clicking a dirt plot will make them plant beans (1 second, add dirt moving sound)
	- Clicking the river will make them drink (1 second, and slurping noise) which lowers their thirst
	
FUTURE BUILDS
	- Move characters using a navigation mesh or A* on block maps? (test different methods... see what works best)
	- Grassy areas (grass should move with wind?)
	- Character inventory (assume multiple characters eventually, all with their own hunger, thirst, exhaustion, fear, etc)
	- Other crops (corn, squash, potatoes) with different growth times and nutritional values
	- Animals (wolves will attack people in the forest, foxes stealing crops, deer wandering to be hunted)
	- Sickness / health factors if a person works passed their exhaustion or doesn't eat enough or drinks too much river water
	- Water gathering and purifying
	- Wandering townsfolk will join the town and you can command them as well
	- Special plants that grow in the forest like mushrooms (for medicine?)
	- Command system which will allow you to give command lists to the characters which they will follow without intervention
	- Bridge building for access to otherwise blocked areas
	- Mining, Blacksmithing, Patrolling, Farming, Water Gathering/Purifying, Foresting, Construction, etc
